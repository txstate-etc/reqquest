# Building your UI on `@reqquest/ui`

`@reqquest/ui` is the whole ReqQuest application, not just a component library. Your project supplies:
- your prompt components
- your registry
- optionally, your own routes

The package supplies everything else. That includes the routes and app shell, Svelte, SvelteKit, Vite and their configuration, and the nginx runtime.

You do not install or configure that toolchain. Its versions are the ones the ReqQuest release was built and tested with, and they move only when you upgrade `@reqquest/ui`.

## What your UI project contains

```
ui/
├── package.json                  dependencies: { "@reqquest/ui": "1.16.0" } and nothing else
├── package-lock.json
├── tsconfig.json                 { "extends": "./.reqquest/tsconfig.json" } (written for you)
├── reqquest-overrides.lock.json  only if you override routes (written for you, commit it)
├── src/
│   ├── local/                    required: index.ts exporting `uiRegistry`, plus your components
│   ├── lib/                      optional: your own shared code, imported as $lib
│   └── routes/                   optional: overrides and additions, see below
└── static/                       optional: merged over ReqQuest's static files
```

**Gitignore `.reqquest/`, `build/` and `build-runtime/`.**

Do not add the following:
- `svelte`, `@sveltejs/kit`, `vite` or `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` to your dependencies
- a `svelte.config.js`, `vite.config.*`, `tailwind.config.js` or `postcss.config.js`

### Why you must not declare the toolchain

`svelte`, `@sveltejs/kit`, `vite` and `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` are exact-pinned peer dependencies of `@reqquest/ui`. npm installs them for you as single top-level copies.

If your `package.json` declares a different version, npm prints `ERESOLVE overriding peer dependency` as a warning and installs yours anyway. Every `reqquest-ui` command then refuses to run and names both versions. Remove the entry and reinstall.

Pin `@reqquest/ui` itself exactly as well. Its version is your toolchain version.

## Commands

Run all commands from the UI project root.

| command | what it does |
|---|---|
| `npx reqquest-ui dev [--host 0.0.0.0 --port 80]` | Assembles `.reqquest/`, then starts the Vite dev server. Edits to `src/local` hot-reload directly. Edits to `src/routes` and `static` re-sync automatically. |
| `npx reqquest-ui build` | Strict sync, then the registry type gate, then the production build. The site goes to `build/`; `nginx.conf` and `apply-env.sh` go to `build-runtime/`. |
| `npx reqquest-ui check` | svelte-check over everything, including `src/local` and your routes. |
| `npx reqquest-ui check-registry` | Fails if `src/local/index.ts` has a type error, such as a prompt the API defines that you have not registered. `build` runs it for you. |
| `npx reqquest-ui sync [--strict] [--accept]` | Only assembles `.reqquest/`; the other commands run it first. |

### `.reqquest/`

`.reqquest/` is a generated SvelteKit project. Its files are read-only and are rewritten on every sync, so don't edit them.

`src/local` and `src/lib` are not copied into it. They are aliased in place (`$local`, `$lib`), so your editor, HMR and the type checker all work on the files you actually edit.

## Overriding and adding routes

Your `src/routes` is laid over ReqQuest's routes. To see the base routes, browse `node_modules/@reqquest/ui/app/src/routes`.

| you want to | do this |
|---|---|
| add a page | Create it: `src/routes/reports/+page.svelte`. A path ReqQuest does not have is simply a new route. |
| change one file of a page | Create the same path: `src/routes/requests/+page.svelte`. Yours replaces that one file, and the base `requests/+page.ts` loader is kept. |
| replace a whole page or section | Add an empty `src/routes/requests/.reqquest-replace`. Every base file under `requests/` is dropped, and only yours remain. Use this when your page needs different load data than the base loader provides. |
| remove a page | In `package.json`: `"reqquest": { "disableRoutes": ["roles/users"] }`. |

**Import through aliases, not relative paths that leave `src/routes`.** Your route files are copied into `.reqquest/src/routes` before building, so `../../lib/x` would point somewhere else. Sync refuses such imports and names them.

Use these instead:
- `$lib` for your `src/lib`
- `$local` for your registry and components
- `@reqquest/ui` for the library

Relative imports between files inside `src/routes` are fine. A file you add can also import a base file next to it, such as `../ApproveLayout.svelte`, because both end up in the same tree.

**`src/internal` cannot be overridden.** Every base route depends on it, so it is not a stable surface. If you need something from it, ask for it to be exported from `@reqquest/ui`.

### Overrides are forks: `reqquest-overrides.lock.json`

When you override or replace a base file, you take ownership of a copy of it. Sync records each forked base file's hash in `reqquest-overrides.lock.json`. **Commit this file.**

When an upgrade changes a base file underneath your override, sync warns you and names the file to compare against. Review the change, carry over whatever you need, then run `npx reqquest-ui sync --accept`.

`build` runs sync in `--strict` mode. Strict mode fails if the lockfile is out of date in any way:
- a drifted override
- an override that was never recorded
- a recorded override that no longer exists

Drift therefore stops your image build instead of shipping unnoticed.

## Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM node:24-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /usr/app
COPY ui/package.json ui/package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY ui/src src
# drop this line if you have no ui/static
COPY ui/static static
# the lockfile is optional; the wildcard lets this COPY succeed without it (package.json always matches)
COPY ui/package.json ui/reqquest-overrides.lock.json* ./
RUN npx reqquest-ui build

FROM alpine:3.22
RUN apk update && apk upgrade && apk add brotli envsubst grep nginx nginx-mod-http-brotli
COPY --from=build /usr/app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY --from=build /usr/app/build-runtime/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
COPY --from=build /usr/app/build-runtime/apply-env.sh /apply-env.sh
CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/apply-env.sh && nginx -g 'daemon off;'"]
```

For a dev image, use the same build stage up to `npm ci`, then:

```dockerfile
CMD ["npx", "reqquest-ui", "dev", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80"]
```

Bind-mount `ui/src` and `ui/static` into `/usr/app`.

The build needs Node 22 or later.

## Environment

`PUBLIC_*` variables use ReqQuest's runtime-substitution scheme: placeholders are baked in at build time, and `apply-env.sh` replaces them when the container starts. Set them on the container as before.

A `.env` in your project root is merged over ReqQuest's template by key, so you only list what you add or change.

## `package.json` options

All options live under a `"reqquest"` key. There are deliberately only two, and no way to change the toolchain:

- **`disableRoutes`**: base routes to remove (see above).
- **`basePath`**: serve the app under a sub-path, e.g. `"/apply"`. This is SvelteKit's `paths.base`.

## Upgrading

1. Bump `@reqquest/ui` and run `npm install`.
2. Run `npx reqquest-ui sync`. It warns about every route you overrode that changed upstream.
3. Review each one, then run `--accept`.
4. Commit the lockfile with the version bump.

Prompt-key coverage is covered separately: see [downstream-setup.md](downstream-setup.md).
