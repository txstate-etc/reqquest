/**
 * Non-blocking does not mean optional. A request cannot reach COMPLETE until every non-blocking requirement on every
 * application has resolved to something other than PENDING - including an application denied during review, because
 * the audit of the reviewer's work is needed whether or not the applicant was approved. Only an application screened
 * out before submission skips non-blocking workflow.
 *
 * In the complex demo only the cat program carries a non-blocking stage (confirm_cat_microchip_service_workflow), so the
 * cat application is the one denied in review here. Foster shares the cat review requirement, so it is denied along with
 * it; it has only a blocking stage, which makes it the control - denied, but with nothing non-blocking owed. The
 * pre-submission exception is not exercised in this demo: every pre-submission requirement that can disqualify is shared
 * by all three programs, so screening the cat out would screen the whole request out and it could never be submitted.
