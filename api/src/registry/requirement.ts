   * to expose it to applicants or reviewers.
   *
   * For another example, what if you have two mutually exclusive programs, like if our adopt a dog and
   * adopt a cat programs didn't allow you to adopt one of each? You would have a requirement/prompt
   * at the end of each program that says "Okay great you qualify, do you want this dog?" and "Okay
   * great you qualify, do you want this cat?" and the requirement for the dog would depend on
   * the prompt for the cat, but you don't want to show the cat prompt to the user when they are
   * applying for the dog. You just want the dog requirement to fail when they say "yes" to the cat
   * and vice versa.
   *
   * By default, listing a prompt here means the requirement waits for it: until the prompt has
   * been answered, none of this requirement's own prompts will be shown and it will stay PENDING.
   * That is usually what you want, but it makes the dependency useless for data that may never
   * arrive, such as a reviewer override that unlocks an applicant who has been disqualified. For
   * that case, list the prompt as `{ key: 'some_prompt', gate: false }` and `resolve` will be
   * called with `undefined` for it until (and unless) it is answered. See `NoDisplayPromptKey`.

  /**
   * Provide a function that can evaluate the requirement based on answers to prompts.
   *
   * This function should not be async, as the justification for a rejection should
   * be part of the permanent record. Any pertinent data retrieved from external systems
   * should be stored by a prompt in the appRequest data.
   *
   * Optionally provide the reason why the resolve function is returning whatever status
   * it is returning. This will be shown to the applicant. It's unlikely a reason is needed
   * for the MET status, but it will be shown if provided. Note that the application will
   * only ever show a single reason, the last one provided by a failing or pending requirement.
   *
   * Optionally provide `blame`, an array of prompt keys naming the answer or answers responsible
   * for the status you are returning. The reviewer UI attaches the status indicator to those
   * prompts instead of every prompt this requirement consults, so a requirement that reads three
   * answers can point at the one that actually failed. Omit it and all of this requirement's
   * prompts are indicated, which is the historical behavior and is usually right for a
   * requirement that only has one prompt. The keys need not belong to this requirement - a
   * reviewer requirement may blame the upstream applicant prompt whose answer it just judged.
   * The keys are checked at compile time against the prompts your project registers, so a typo or a
   * key you have since renamed will not compile. Nothing is filtered at runtime, though: a key
   * naming a prompt the viewer cannot currently see simply has no effect.
   *
   * These values will be cached until the appRequest is updated in some way.
   *
   * You'll receive the appRequestData, the configuration data, and a lookup object that
   * contains the configuration data for all requirements and prompts in the system, in
   * case you need to rely on the configuration from one of the required prompts.
   *
   * NOTE: The appRequest data passed to this function will only include data from prompts
   * that are required by this requirement and requirements that appear before this one
   * in execution order. This is to prevent situations where answering a prompt late in the
   * application process could change the determination made earlier in the process. You'll
   * have to carefully design and order your requirements to ensure that the data you need
   * is available to you.
   *
   * The one exception is a prompt listed in `promptKeysNoDisplay` with `gate: false`, which is
   * explicitly allowed to show up late and change this requirement's determination. Anything
   * you receive that way may be `undefined` on one call and populated on the next.
