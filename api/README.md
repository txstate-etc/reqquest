# ReqQuest API

This library provides the core structure and utilities for building ReqQuest projects. It includes the GraphQL API, data models, and other backend functionalities. As a ReqQuest project developer, you will primarily create definitions for Programs, Requirements, and Prompts. ReqQuest will put it all together for you and make sure applicants can answer their prompts and submit their requests, while reviewers can answer their own prompts to meet all the requirements you specified.
